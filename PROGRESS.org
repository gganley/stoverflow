* Changes
- Move from cbox to table
- Move back to cbox since you can't detect what is selected in the table
- Can't recreate objects in cbox so moving to qt
- Had to install qt 5.11.1 instaed of the current 5.12.0 to work with therecipe/qt library
* Notes
- `qtdeploy -fast build desktop; ./deploy/darwin/stoverflow.app/Contents/MacOS/stoverflow` will allow for debug output
- qtdeploy -fast only works on unclean projects
